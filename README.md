# Framework for an Isometric RPG

Dungeon crawler roguelike in the style of Diablo 2

Currently contains a keyboard-controlled movement system and a L+R mouse button controlled, cooldown-based magic casting system.

Also contain gauge indicators, enemy spawners, and conversation engine. 

To do:
* Improve magic combination casting system - more complex inputs for stronger casts? Permanent combinations? etc.
* Add more spells


Please note that this game will not compile; sprites have not been included in the Github repo due to size constraints and copyright concerns.
